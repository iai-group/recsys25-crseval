# Prompts for LLM-US

This folder contains the two prompts used by LLM-US, one to decide whether or not to stop the conversation and another to generate the next utterance. For these prompts, we use a zero-shot approach.

  * [Stop prompt](stopping.md): This prompt is used to decide whether or not to stop the conversation given the current history.
  * [Next utterance prompt](utterance_generation.md): This prompt is used to generate the next utterance given a set of requirements, represented by constraints and requests, and the conversation history
